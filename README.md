# 🚦 Smartflow: AI-based Traffic Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
**Smartflow** is an AI-powered traffic management system developed as a final year B.Tech project.  
The system leverages **image-sensing cameras and AI algorithms** to monitor vehicle density at junctions and dynamically adjust signal timings.  

It aims to reduce **traffic congestion**, ensure **emergency vehicle clearance**, and provide **real-time traffic updates** to users via a mobile app.

## ✨ Features
- 🔍 **Real-Time Vehicle Density Detection** – Cameras and AI models monitor traffic flow.  
- ⏱️ **Dynamic Traffic Signal Control** – Automatic signal adjustment based on density.  
- 🚑 **Emergency Vehicle Priority** – Registered emergency vehicles get automatic route clearance.  
- 📊 **Data Insights & Reports** – Junction-level analytics for traffic planning.  
- 📱 **User Application** – Mobile app shows congestion levels, alternate routes, and real-time updates.  
- 🖥️ **Admin Dashboard** – Centralized monitoring and control of traffic junctions.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
1. **Traffic Signal Controller**  
   - Processes input from cameras.  
   - Adjusts green/red light duration dynamically.  

2. **User Application (Mobile App)**  
   - Shows live congestion data.  
   - Provides rerouting suggestions.  

3. **Admin Dashboard (Web App)**  
   - Displays real-time junction monitoring.  
   - Allows administrators to configure or override signals.  

4. **Emergency Vehicle Module**  
   - Emergency vehicles register in the system.  
   - Clears congestion automatically along their route.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Minimize **traffic congestion** using AI-driven control.  
- Provide **priority clearance** for emergency vehicles.  
- Deliver **real-time traffic updates** to users.  
- Support **data-driven decision-making** for city traffic planning.  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- 🌐 **IoT Integration** – Smart sensors across the city for wider coverage.  
- 🤖 **AI Prediction Models** – Forecast traffic trends and congestion hotspots.  
- ☁️ **Cloud Deployment** – Scale the solution for large cities.  
- 🗺️ **Enhanced User App** – Real-time navigation, alerts, and voice assistance.
